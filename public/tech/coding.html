          <p>Everyone in the society now has risen to the knowledge of what coding or programming is.
            Programming can be seen as you giving a computer a set of instructions with the sole aim 
            of achieving an end product based on your choice. I'm not really going to talk in details 
            about what programming is. It is a modern day technology which has taken the mind of almost
            every youth and teen that wants to do much more in the technology sector. Thousands of people
            everyday look into the lucrative field of programming. Yes, I call it Lucrative. If it wasn't 
            for the numerous benefits attached to it, it could have been thrown under the carpet. The 
            first programming language is FORTRAN, and it was created in the 50's. That's a very long time
            from today. But programming hasn't lost it's flare for being interesting and also educative in the society. 
            Programming has birthed most video games, powerful websites, Data science analysis and so on. </p><br>
            <p>Why is coding still very interesting? 
            Coding allows programmers to get together to build something unique, share ideas, innovate, solve problems
            and learn new things every day. The community formed by programmers makes it interesting for people. 
            You tend to meet people who you couldn't have known if not for coding . There is togetherness in building
            something great and unique. That's one interesting fact about coding.</p><br>
            <p>Programmers can always grow, learn and master the skills by learning and seeking more challenging problems
            and solving them. Programming is something that evolves as time goes. Newer versions, techniques, terms and 
            frameworks are being formed ooccasionally. A programmer keeps up to date with every possible change. Sometimes
            New technologies come out before you even release your product. This makes it even more interesting.</p><br>
            <p>Programmers are never bored. A good programmer never feels that he has nothing to do. There's always something 
            new to learn or to do. The real fun about coding is you being able to create. So long as you can use your brain 
            effectively to create and to think. You can do exploits with coding. Most programmers who have been known to build
            amazing things never stopped working with their minds. Your ability to create makes programming interesting</p><br>
            <p>Programming can pay really well. This proves to be the first and best motivation for aspiring programmers and even 
            those already in the field. The average income in the USA is somewhere along $50k per year. Programmers earn about $90k
            per year in salaries. They can easily earn in the range of $120-150k per year. Money is a key motivation in almost
            everything we do in life. No one wants to live a life of poverty. Financial freedom is an everyday yearning for every
            individual . Coding has made lots of people millionaires. There is no guarantee that programming will make you rich in one
            day, but it will surely keep you out of the poverty line if you are really good and experienced. </p><br>
            <p>Programming is a real career. It's going to keep you engaged for almost the rest of your life. Programming evolves and 
            there are many stages to which you can go through as a programmer. Full stack developers will earn more than a front end developer.
            Programmers can be associate developers, staff engineers and so on according to your qualifications. Most jobs are not careers. For 
            example being a taxi driver or a bartender. But coding gives you a career which makes it more interesting to engage in.</p><br>
