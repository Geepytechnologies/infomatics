            <p id="firstp">Dogs have become an integral part of almost every home. It is no longer a surprise how the human race has managed to take care of their own children and still be able to keep Dogs as pests in the same home.
            Humorist Josh Billings once said, “A Dog is the only thing on Earth that loves you more than he loves himself”. Dogs are ever loving but they can be very dangerous and extremely aggressive.
            You’re going to know more about the 10 most Aggressive dogs in the world as you read on.</p><br>
            <p id="secondp">Dogs display Loyalty, bravery and intelligence in the face of imminent danger to protect family members. The relationship between Dogs and humans goes back millennia. Most people refer to Dogs as some kind of super humans.
               You can argue that fact but Dogs are not just an Ordinary Pet. The remains of the earliest traceable domesticated dog were found during World War 1,
               though it wasn’t until scientists revealed that its mandible was a direct ancestor of the modern domesticated dogs that lived around 14,500 years ago. After centuries upon centuries of selective breeding, dogs are now the most abundant terrestrial carnivores on the planet and come in all manners of shapes, sizes, and colors. Humans interact with animals in numerous ways and on numerous levels. We are indeed living in an “animal’s world” in the sense that our lives are very much intertwined with the lives of animals. This also means that animals, like those dogs we commonly refer to as our pets, are living in a “human’s world” in the sense that it is us, not them, who to an extent, define and manage the interactions we have with them. Dogs have been part of human societies longer than any other domestic species, they exemplify the role of companion animals. Dogs are great for personal security and property security, as well as detection thanks to their ordinary sense of smell. They are incredibly intelligent animals. They have an ability to pick up on voices and body languages to translate a situation or emotion, and are even more capable when they are trained properly. They put this skill of theirs to good use, and are able to sense when things are not quite right, whether with a person or with a situation. Dogs can detect danger, and the breeds that are chosen to be security dogs aren’t afraid to do something about it. Being able to perform such high standards of security comes with a high level of aggression which most times makes them very dangerous.

              <p id="p4">The most viscous breed of Dog is the American pit bull terrier.</p>

                 I’ll tell you more about the American pit bull later in the Article. Continue reading………….</p>
            <p id="p6"><h4>Most protective breed of dog</h4></p>
            <p>Most people might have their different views about this one but I’m going to give this one to the BULL MASTIFF. 
              This breed had an unusual beginning. They were bred to keep large estates free of poachers by tracking and pinning without causing harm. A silent guardian. 
              They are known as being fearless and confident (courageous).</p>

            <p><h4>Why are dogs aggressive all of a sudden?</h4></p>
            <p>There are quite a couple of reasons why dogs get aggressive all of a sudden. So many breeds of dogs react in different ways and at different moments.
            Dogs react to people, Environmental changes and more importantly health factors. Medical conditions can cause dogs to become aggressive. If a dog has never shown any sign of aggression suddenly begins growling, snapping or biting.
            It may be caused by a disease or illness.</p>
            <p>Pain is an especially common cause of aggression in dogs. Most dog owners haven’t still realized this. 
            Your suddenly aggressive Dog may have an injury or an illness that’s causing major discomfort and stress. 
            Though there are some naturally most aggressive dogs, these may be a major cause of your dog being aggressive.
            Some possible causes of pain include arthritis, bone fractures, internal injuries, and various tumors .Other illnesses may affect your dog’s brain leading to seemingly unreasonable aggression.
            Although these problems are likely to occur in older dogs but can happen at any age.</p><br> 
            <p>Another factor can be Fear. Yes, I mean the fear you know all about. Apart from having most aggressive dogs take the limelight.
            Dogs too can exhibit a high sense of fear or danger. Most dogs only exhibit aggressive behavior if they sense that they are in danger, cannot escape, and feel the need to defend themselves.
            Dogs never like being attacked, they will always get back at you.</p><br>
            <p>Another reason is possessiveness. Possession aggression occurs when a dog is possessive of something.
            A dog that exhibits possession aggression may growl if someone approaches his food bowl or gets too close when he is chewing a bone.
            Irrespective of what breed the dog is. A dog may also bite a stranger who steps into your home, which is the dog’s territory.</p>
            <p>Another reason is show of Dominance. Dogs sometimes behave aggressively as a display of dominance. This is often directed toward bother dogs, but it can occur with people as well.
            Dominance is a behavior, not a personality trait. Dogs are not dominant by nature. Dominance is well defined by circumstances. They just want to prove that they are in charge of a situation.</p> 
            <p>Another reason is frustration. Frustration causes aggression. When a dog is not able to get something it takes its frustration out in another way. 
            This is common in dogs that spend a lot of time tied up, restrained on a chain.</p>
            <p><h4>Can an aggressive dog be cured?</h4></p>
            <p>You need to be careful not to misinterpret your dog’s aggression. Always rule out a health issue or fear before you assume you know the reason for your dog’s aggressive behavior.
            The Only way an aggressive dog can be cured is by knowing the reason for the dog’s aggressiveness, then you can now take corrective measures. You can also visit a veterinarian near you. You can’t do all by yourself.
            Now you’ve seen in general how dogs behave and certain characteristics associated with certain breeds. Let’s look at the list of the most aggressive dogs.</p><br>
            <p><span><h4>1)	AMERICAN PIT BULL TERRIER:</h4></span> The American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_breed">dog breed</a> recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC)[1] and the American Dog Breeders Association (ADBA),
            but not the American Kennel Club (AKC).
            It is a medium-sized, intelligent, short-haired dog, of a solid build, whose early ancestors came from the British Isles. When compared with the English Staffordshire Bull Terrier, 
            the American Pit Bull Terrier is larger by margins of 6–8 inches 
            (15–20 cm) in height and 25–35 pounds (11–16 kg) in weight. The American Pit Bull Terrier varies in size: males are normally about 18–21 inches (45–53 cm) in height and around 35–60 pounds (15–27 kg) in weight, 
            while females are normally around 17–20 inches (43–50 cm) in height and 30–50 pounds (13–22 kg) in weight.</p><br>
            <div class="img3"></div>
            <p><i>Image-credit: www.thedogguy.com</i></p><br>
            
            <p>This massive animal has been banned by twelve (12) countries across Europe as well as in the United States, Canada, Ecuador, Malaysia, Australia and most countries in the world.
            The essential characteristics of the American Pit Bull Terrier are strength, confidence, and zest for life. This breed is eager to please and brimming over with enthusiasm. APBTs make excellent family companions and have always been noted for their love of children.
            Because most APBTs exhibit some level of [inter]dog aggression and because of its powerful physique, the APBT requires an owner who will carefully socialize and obedience train the dog. The breed's natural agility makes it one of the most capable canine climbers so good fencing is a must for this breed. 
            The APBT is not the best choice for a guard dog since they are extremely friendly, even with strangers. Aggressive behaviour toward humans is characteristic of the breed and highly undesirable. This breed does very well in performance events because of its high level of intelligence and its willingness to work.
            This is the most aggressive dog in the world as at the tear 2021.</p><br>
            
            <p><h4>2)	ROTTWEILER:</h4>The Rottweiler is a breed of domestic dog, regarded as medium-to-large or large. The dogs were known in German as Rottweiler Metzgerhund, meaning Rottweil butchers' dogs, because their main use was to herd livestock and pull carts laden with butchered meat to market.
            This continued until the mid-19th century when railways replaced droving. Although still used to herd stock in many parts of the world, Rottweiler’s are now also used as search and rescue dogs, guard dogs and police dogs.</p>
            <div class="img4"></div>
            <p><i>Image-credit: www.hillspet.com</i></p>
            This breed is all about balance, endurance, proportionality, intelligence and strength. A well-bred and properly raised Rottie (Rottweiler) will be calm and confident, courageous but not unduly aggressive. But this fearful breed of dog still stands as the 2nd most aggressive dog in the world in 2021.<br> 
            
            <p><h4>3)	GERMAN SHEPHERD:</h4> Generally considered as the finest all-purpose worker, the German Shepherd Dog is a large, agile, muscular dog of noble character and high intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the German shepherd is truly a dog lover’s delight. There are many reasons why German 
            Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine royalty, but experts say their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to learn commands for many tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line in defence of loved ones. German Shepherds will be gentle family pets
            and steadfast guardians.</p>

            <p><i>Image-credit: www.akc.org</i></p>
            This ranks as the 3rd most aggressive dog in the world.<br>
            
            <p><h4>4)	SIBERIAN HUSKY:</h4> The Siberian Husky dog breed has a beautiful, thick coat that comes in a multitude of colors and markings. Their blue or multi-colored eyes and striking facial masks only add to the appeal of this breed, which originated in Siberia. It is easy to see why many are drawn to the Siberian’s
            wolf-like looks, but beware because this athletic, intelligent dog can act independently and challenge first-time dog parents.</p>

            <p><h4>5) ALASKAN MALAMUTE:</h4> The Alaskan Malamute features a powerful, sturdy body built for stamina and strength. It reigns as one of the oldest <span><a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds">dog breeds</a></span> whose original looks have not been significantly altered. This intelligent canine needs a job and consistent leadership to avoid becoming bored or challenging to handle.

            <p><h4>6)	DOBERMAN PINSCHER:</h4> Sleek and powerful, possessing both a magnificent physique and keen intelligence, the Doberman Pinscher is one of dog kind’s noblemen. This incomparably fearless and vigilant breed stands proudly among the world's finest protection dogs.</p>
            <div class="img8"></div>
            <p><i>Image-credit: <a href="www.dogbreedslist.info">www.dogbreedslist.info</a></i></p><br>
            
            <p><h4>7)	CHOW CHOW:</h4> The distinctive-looking Chow Chow dog breed has a proud, independent spirit that some describe as catlike. They can be aloof — if you’re looking for a cuddle buddy, this probably isn’t the best breed for you — and downright suspicious of strangers. But for the right person, they can be a fiercely loyal companion.</p>
            <div class="img9"></div>
            <p><i>Image-credit: <a href="www.dogtime.com">www.dogbreedslist.info</a></i></p><br>
            
            <p><h4>8)	GREAT DANE:</h4> As tall as 32 inches at the shoulder, Danes tower over most other dogs—and when standing on their hind legs, they are taller than most people. These powerful giants are the picture of elegance and balance, with the smooth and easy stride of born noblemen. 
            The coat comes in different colors and patterns,perhaps the best-known being the black-and-white patchwork pattern known as “harlequin.”
            Despite their sweet nature, Danes are alert home guardians. Just the sight of these gentle giants is usually enough to make intruders think twice. But those foolish enough to mistake the breed’s friendliness for softness will meet a powerful foe of true courage and spirit.
            Patient with kids, Danes are people pleasers who make friends easily.</p>

            <p><h4>9)	ST BERNARD:</h4> The Saint Bernard’s written standard abounds with phrases like “very powerful,” “extraordinarily muscular,” “imposing,” and “massive.” A male stands a minimum 27.5 inches at the shoulder; females will be smaller and more delicately built.</p>
             
            <p><h4>10)	PRESA CANARIO:</h4>  
            This ranks the 10th on my list.</p>
