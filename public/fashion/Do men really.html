       <h2><p>Do men really notice what women wear</p></h2>
       <p>Most men are always fascinated with the fact that their live looks incomplete without the women around.
        We live in a society of mixed gender. The male and the females. It's a truth everyone has come to live with.
        It is always a natural scenario for men to be emotionally and sexually attracted to the women. But there's 
        this physical attraction which always acts as a catalyst to every Emotion or feeling stirred amongst the 
        men towards the women. Men can't really help but admire any woman who they seem to come across. 
        What are these physical attributes that gets the attention of the men so easily, facial looks, 
        body physique and also what a woman puts on her body. </p><br>
        <p>Now this is where the big question comes.."Do men really notice what women wear"?
        The answer to that question is about to be discovered in about a little time as you read on. 
        Firstly, Men don't really care about what you wear. The most important thing most men care about is
        when you put on something that shows your body figure. That may not sound good, but nothing is 
        appropriate in our world now anyways. Men notice your body physique first before they see what you are wearing. 
        Now don't get confused with the fact that it is through your choice of clothing that makes that perfect body 
        physique come alive and to get more attention. Men want to see those cleavages. That gets noticed first
        </p><br>
        <p>Men won't notice that you are wearing something new. Apparently, only one who lives in your wardrobe would
        notice that you had a new pair of clothes. And that usually happens because men are always happy to see you. 
        The fulfillment of seeing a long time friend especially the opposite gender takes center stage before facial appearance 
        and looks get noticed. Not all men think the same way, many have their opinions as to which they see life and certain things.
        But a higher percentage of the men don't notice what a woman is wearing at first sight</p><br>
        <p>Another interesting factor, is that like birds flock together. What do I mean by that? I'll explain. Men who care about 
        what they wear or how they wear it will also look out for women who are fashion conscious. Men in this category get 
        fascinated when a lady rocks a designer gown, shoe, jewellery. They see those kind of women as being the perfect match to 
        the idealogy which they already have. So they will always want to look good together wherever they go. Men who care about 
        what they wear will always want to rock a social function with their women in the best fashionable style. </p><br>
        <div class="fashionimg"></div>
        <p>Men think about how cool or attractive you look. What you wear plays an impact on the minds of men but it's solely dependent
        on different kinds of men. Like I said earlier, people think differently. Men focus on your face and body , they won't get fascinated
        with overpriced shoes and handbags. Although,most men feel happy hanging out with ladies who spend a whole lot of cash on their body,
        most men would rather feel insecure associating with such women</p><br>
        <p>Men notice clothes that makes a woman stand out amongst others. When a group of ladies come across a guy, the lady with the most outstanding
        and beautiful outfit gets the highest level of notice. A lady's wear is mostly noticed when she is among her peers or friends. This is why most 
        women are always at a fashion war with their peers, competiting for glory or a higher respect. I believe every woman should be able to dress in
        the most attractive and decent manner. Nobody really dresses to get attention. Self confidence is the a major reason why putting on a good wear is very important. 
        In whatsoever way you dress that's how you are gonna be addressed. People talk to you in the manner in which you dress. Men will talk to a lady who dresses seductively
        in a seductive manner, a lady who smells of good scent or perfume will earn a higher respect for reputability. Just by the scent of her perfume. Anyone who dresses well will always be noticed.
        You can't be hidden wherever their is light. In that manner, good dressing throws a light on the face of the individual which can't be resisted. </p><br>
